The project will be compared against three benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Random approach}, to ensure the model is better than the most basic model.
\item \textbf{-110 average rewarding}, as stated in \href{https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#mountaincar-v0}{OpenAI's documentation} for the MountainCar-v0 the problem pass criteria is a reward of -110 in 100 consecutive episodes
\item \textbf{Leader board}, as explained in the same \href{https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#mountaincar-v0}{documentation} there are two algorithms that met the pass criteria as shown in Table\ref{tab:crit}.
