Machine learning, in layman terms, consists of programming the computer to learn from previous data. A more detail description could be given as stated in \cite{MLState}: "Machine learning is the process (algorithm) of estimating a model thatâ€™s true to the real-world problem with a certain probability
from a dataset (or sample) generated by finite observations in a noisy environment."

Today Machine Learning's method Deep Reinforcement Learning is gaining popularity since lots of applications has been given to it, such as Video Games, unmanned vehicles, and control systems. The latter is a well-known field where the goal is to make dynamical systems behave in a desired manner, to achieve this it is required to obtain the mathematical model of the system as explained in \cite{Control}

Since control systems are dynamic, all its environments are modeled as a continuous state space and most of the times as a continuous action space as well. Therefore, it signifies a challenging task to solve by machine learning, some of the algorithms able to tackle these problems are deep Q learning (for infinite state spaces and discrete action spaces), and actor-critic methods (for infinite state and action spaces). 

Most of the times it is not possible to know all the system features thus it is not possible to get the mathematical model of the system, that is the main reason why a Reinforcement Learning approach could be useful to solve the problem. One approach of Reinforcement Learning applied to Control systems is presented in "A heuristic approach to reinforcement learning control systems" \cite{1098193}

\subsection{Motivation}
The motivation behind this project is because control is one of the required fields for robotics, in more specific for self-driving cars, where I would love to be involved in. Finally, I am convinced that my previous knowledge of control theory will be enhanced by relating Machine Learning with Control Systems, where there is a lot of room to work in. Therefore my main goal is to enlarge my experience in the combination of Deep Reinforcement Learning with Control Systems.
